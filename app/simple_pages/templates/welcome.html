                            <p>The database management system not only aids in the effective storage of data, but also
                                in the
                                sharing of
                                data throughout the business. Programmers, system administrators, and end-users are all
                                involved
                                in such an
                                environment. There are five components in a database environment: data, hardware,
                                software,
                                people, and
                                procedures. Multiple users can easily access the data and share it with other users
                                without
                                having to go
                                through any additional steps. In only a few seconds, the system can assist you find the
                                information you need
                                from a big database. As a result, managing various sorts of data, such as student

                            <p>PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python
                                programming
                                language. It
                                helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI. PyTest is
                                mainly
                                used for
                                writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to complex
                                functional
                                tests.

                            <p>Pytest assertions are checks that return either True or False status. In Python Pytest,
                                if an
                                assertion fails
                                in a test method, then that method execution is stopped there. The remaining code in
                                that test
                                method is not
                                executed, and Pytest assertions will continue with the next test method.
                            </p>
                            <p> In the code for this Project the pytest has been performed for each webpage by asserting

                                from each.
                                Intitally the pytest failed due to snake case style, the pytest checks if all the

                            <p>With the command <strong>pip install pytest</strong> you can install Pytest. Once the
                                installation is
                                done,<strong> import pytest</strong> helps to import modules from the pytest.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Naming convention for files:</strong> keep your tests in a <strong>tests</strong>
                                directory in the
                                root folder of the application. Pytest recommends that test file names begin with the
                                format
                                <strong>test_*.py</strong>
                                or end with format <strong>**_test.py</strong>, Using these formats enables Pytest to
                                auto-discover the test
                                files easily and also minimizes confusion when running tests.
                            </p>
                            <p>In this project I have included the tests to make sure that I receive atleast one
                                combination of
                                words
                                provided in the assertion.</p>
                            <p><strong>testing with pytest</strong> To run Pytest tests, you can either use py.test or
                                pytest in
                                the
                                terminal. You can also run a single file by explicitly specifying the filename after the
                                Pytest
                                command:
                                pytest (your filename).py. When these commands are executed, Pytest automatically finds
                                all the
                                tests in
                                either the root directory, or in the specified single file.

                                When no test files have been explicitly defined, Pytest executes any tests in the root
                                directory
                                that follow
                                the standard naming pattern, without you needing to specify filenames or directories.
                            </p>
                            <p>Pytest marks a passed test with a green dot .; it marks a failed test with a red F. Count
                                the
                                number of dots
                                or Fs to figure out how many tests passed and failed, and in what execution order.

                                Typically, a repository is used to organize a single project. Repositories can hold
                                anything
                                your project
                                need, including folders and files, photos, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. A README
                                file,
                                which
                                contains information about your project, is frequently included in repositories. The
                                Markdown
                                language is
                                used to write README files. This <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">cheat

                                help you get started with Markdown syntax. When you create
                                a new repository on GitHub, you can add a README file at the same time. Other common
                                options,
                                such as a

                            <h2 class="post-title"><strong>Branch</strong></h2>
                            <p>A branch is a version of a repository that exists in two places at the same time. It is
                                contained
                                within the
                                repository, but it has no effect on the primary or main branch, allowing you to operate
                                freely
                                without
                                causing any disruption to the "live" version. You can merge your branch back into the
                                main
                                branch to publish
                                your modifications once you've finished making the changes you desire.</p>
                            <p>
                                Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in
                                a
                                contained area of
                                your repository.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new
                                branch
                                from the
                                default branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation
                                from
                                changes that other
                                people are making to the repository. A branch you create to build a feature is commonly
                                referred
                                to as a
                                feature branch or topic branch
                            </p>
                            <p> When we create any new repository in GitHub, the GitHub creates the repository with a
                                single
                                branch. This
                                branch is default branch for repository, and it's the branch that will be shown to
                                anyone
                                visiting your
                                GitHub Profile. When you try to clone the repository code, the default branch will be
                                cloned
                                unless you have
                                selected specific branch to code. </p>

                                As we work, adding commits allows us to keep track of our progress and modifications.
                                Each
                                commit is treated
                                as a "save point" by Git. It's a time in the project where you can go back and fix a bug
                                or make
                                a
                                modification.

                            <p>
                                We should always provide a message when we commit. It's easy for you (and others) to
                                know what's
                                changed and
                                when by adding clear messages to each commit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong> Description about commit</strong>Create a new commit containing the current
                                contents of
                                the index
                                and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of
                                HEAD,
                                usually the tip
                                of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it.
                                The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:
                            </p>
                            <p> â€¢before using the commit command, use <strong>git-add .</strong> to incrementally "add"
                                changes
                                to the index
                                (Note: even updated files must be "added")
                            </p>
                            <p> â€¢before performing the commit command, by using <strong>git-rm</strong> to remove files
                                from the
                                working
                                tree and index
                            </p>
                            <p> â€¢by passing files as arguments to the commit command (without the â€”interactive or â€”patch
                                options), which
                                causes the commit to disregard changes staged in the index and instead record the
                                current
                                content of the
                                listed files (which Git must already be aware of)
                            </p>
                            <p> â€¢by using the -a switch with the commit command to automatically "add" changes from all
                                known
                                files and to
                                automatically "rm" files in the index that have been deleted from the working tree,
                                before
                                actually
                                committing
                            </p>
                            <p> â€¢before concluding the transaction, by using the â€”interactive or â€”patch switches with
                                the commit
                                command to
                                pick one by one which files or hunks should be included in the commit, in addition to
                                contents
                                in the index.
                            </p>
                            <p> The <strong>--dry-run</strong> option can be used to obtain a summary of what is
                                included by any
                                of the
                                above for the next commit by giving the same set of parameters
                            </p>
                            <p>If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after that, you can recover from

                                The "merge" command is used to integrate changes from another branch. The target of this
                                integration (i.e.
                                the branch that receives changes) is always the currently checked out HEAD branch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Git can perform most integrations automatically, some changes will result in
                                conflicts
                                that have to be
                                solved by the user. The great part of Git's merging process is that it uses the familiar
                                edit/stage/commit
                                workflow to resolve merge conflicts. When you encounter a merge conflict, running the
                                <strong>git
                                    status</strong> command shows you which files need to be resolved.When Git
                                encounters a conflict
                                during a
                                merge, It will edit the content of the affected files with visual indicators that mark

                                the ======= marker is the receiving branch and the part after is the merging branch.
                                <strong>Git merge</strong> will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified
                                history.

                                frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.

                            <p>Through scripting or direct CLI instructions, the CLI employs Docker APIs to control or

                            <p>A container is a standard software unit that encapsulates code and all of its
                                dependencies so
                                that the

                                container image
                                is a small, standalone software package that contains everything needed to run a
                                program,
                                including code,
                                runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.</p>
                            <p>At runtime, container images become containers, and when Docker containers run on Docker
                                Engine,
                                images
                                become containers. Containerized software, which is available for both Linux and
                                Windows-based
                                applications,
                                will always run the same independent of the infrastructure. Containers separate software
                                from
